## What belongs in a web site?

Probably fewer gifs than on Homer's page (or in this workshop). Either way, what belongs in a web site depends on the kind of site you're creating. Some types of sites you might want to build include:

## How do you decide what the design of your site should be?

We usually know good design when we see it, but it can be harder to produce it ourselves. It helps to review some tips for effective web design:

- [4 key principles of web design](https://99designs.com/blog/tips/web-design-basics-guide/)

But one of the most important parts of good design is to suit the design to the content, uses, and audience. This means good design will vary depending on what your goals are for your website. For that reason, it can be helpful to start by thinking about what your website needs to do, and how it should look in order to accomplish that.

### Sketching and wireframing

Before you start building your website--even before you start looking at themes and templates--it helps to get your design ideas organized. Start with a rough sketch of the page. Where will the images go? Where will the menu go? Which content will go on which part of the page, and in what order?

Once you have a sketch, you can move on to a wireframe, which is a more complete plan of your website design and organization. You can make a wireframe using paper and pencil, or using one of several digital tools for wireframing.

## Publishing your website 
You've been viewing your website in your browser, but it's not yet live on the Web. To do so, we need to upload the files to the server that hosts your website. Remember, a website is just a collection of files and folders on someone's computer.
