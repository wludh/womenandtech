# Afternoon - Portfolio Creation

## 1:00-1:30pm - What belongs in a portfolio?
Emma Thai + Hannah Kearns '22 talk about lessons learned from alums and career development about what a portfolio should contain. How do you decide what to include?


## 1:30-2:00pm - Wireframing exercise 
Now is the time to start brainstorming your own portfolio. We've provided some analog methods on the table, but you can also use digital options like [Wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/) or even options like [Canva](http://www.canva.com) to sketch out your ideas. Before you start drafting, think over and discuss the following questions:

* What am I most proud of? What is unique about my experiences, skills, journey, etc?
* What field(s) am I interested in pursuing? How do other professionals in that field represent themselves? Are there do/don'ts that I should be aware of? 
* How do I want my portfolio to look? To feel? What words come to mind? What would go on your mood board? 
* Getting into details now - what specific components does my website need? Should it be a long scroll-y page or have a really precise menu? Should I just upload my resume or break it into specific components? What sample work should I include? Is there anything I should be careful about sharing? What context do I need to add to make a project make sense? 


## 2:00-2:30 Platforms and beyond

Now that we've learned some code and started the design process, let's talk platforms. 

Things to keep in mind when choosing a platform:
* **Cost** - How much are you willing to spend monthly/annually to keep up your portfolio? Does the platform have any hidden fees? Note that to register a custom domain like www.myname.com you will probably pay at least $15/year just to keep the domain name. 
* **Purpose** - What is the point of your portfolio? Does the platform cater to that purpose? Are you trying to sell items and therefore need an e-commerce option? Are you trying to host a lot of multimedia and need a gallery feature? Is there a platform that is common in your industry that you want to demonstrate expertise in? 
* **Mobile** - While this is the default these days, it's always good to make sure your platform can deliver a mobile-friendly website.
* **SEO** - 
* **Ethics** - Some web hosting companies don't have the best reputation. Do a little research to make sure you're working with someone that isn't actively doing harm.
