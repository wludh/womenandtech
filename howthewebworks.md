## My website needs pictures

Of course it does! But where do you get the pictures? And where do they go?

### File structures

(There are no diagrams of file structures that aren't boring)

## How do you make your web page look even more exciting?

Add CSS to modify the presentation of the elements. Remeber, HTML specifies what kind of thing a piece of content is, and CSS controls how that piece of content appears to the user.

## What is CSS?

You need:
- A styles.css file
- A way to tell your web page where to find the styles.css file

## Try it out

1. Create a file called styles.css.
2. Edit your index.html file to tell it where to find styles.css.
3. Create a class in your stylesheet with a unique name.
4. Define the class so that it changes the color and the size of text.
5. Assign the class to a `<p>` element in your website.
